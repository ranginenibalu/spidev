Recent times ZigBee based wireless sensor networks 

are gaining popularity in various application domain areas like 

healthcare, structural health monitoring, home and commercial 

building automation, industrial automation, transportation, 

agriculture etc. ZigBee standard provides various domain 

specific application profiles. The sensors are interfaced to ZigBee 

communication modules to form a wireless personal area 

network. In order to control and communicate to these networks 

from backbone infrastructure networks viz. 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi a 

wireless enabled gateway is essential. The hardware platforms 

and software framework for such Gateways need to be 

application domain independent to make the systems generic. 

The work that has been presented in this paper focuses on 

hardware system design issues and options, software framework 

and application case studies. The gateway subsystem has been 

enabled with sufficient storage for local data buffering. The 

system consists of three modules namely WINGZ (Wireless IP 

Network Gateway for Zigbee), Ubimote (Wireless ZigBee mote 

with generic sensor interface) and Ubi-Sense (Generic Sensor 

board) for application case study. The Gateway Related 

hardware and software systems enable anywhere connectivity of 

networked sensors. The heart of the system is WINGZ which is 

an android based multi protocol wireless gateway supporting 

WLAN, HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), ZigBee and 

Ethernet.
